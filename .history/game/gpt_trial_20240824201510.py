1. **File Content and Format**: What type of data or code does the file contain? Is it a game environment, agent logic, simulation results, or something else?
It will contain a game environment, and methods to get simulation results for a single game (later I will run many games and analyse the resutls)
The actor logic will be contained in a file called Actor.py


2. **Specific Tasks**: What specific actions do you want to perform on the file? Are you looking to modify the environment, 
analyze simulation data, fine-tune RL algorithms, or something different?
I want to passs in a given enviorment in csv format, and then allow the actors to play the game within the Game class.


3. **Visualizations**: You mentioned enabling visualization as a project goal. Should the file be used to generate or modify visual outputs, 
such as GIFs or animations of game simulations?
I want to create a GIF from the simulation results, this include movementss of actors within the game.

4. **Data Analysis**: If the focus is on analyzing game outcomes (e.g., capture times, strategy trends), what metrics or insights are you most interested in extracting?
I only want to record these metrics, total time take, paths of actors, actors win or not.

5. **Collaboration or Refinement**: Do you want assistance with developing code, adjusting algorithms, tuning parameters, or documenting insights?
I want assistance developing the code. Tuning parameters will be in a sepearate file.
