# General Tasks

- [ ] **(P1) Clean `src`**: Refactor and organize source code for clarity and maintainability.
- [ ] **Add Q-learning and SARSA class descriptions to `description.md`**: Update the documentation to include detailed descriptions of the Q-learning and SARSA classes.

# Tasks: Implementation Steps

### 1. Setup the Environment
- [ ] **Implement a 2D grid with obstacles and an exit point**: Initialize the grid with empty cells, obstacles, and an exit point.
- [ ] **Define grid boundaries and constraints**: Ensure actors cannot move outside the grid.

### 2. Create the Actor Classes
- [ ] **Implement movement and decision-making processes**: Define methods for moving and deciding actions based on current state and policy.
- [ ] **Add sightline detection**: Implement the sightline feature for detecting visible cells and obstacles.
- [ ] **Implement specific behaviors for Hunter**: Define how the hunter chases the prey and updates its policy accordingly.
- [ ] **Implement specific behaviors for Prey**: Define how the prey evades the hunter and moves towards the exit.

### 4. Develop Game Class
- [ ] **Create a game loop**: Develop the main game loop to handle actor movements, update the grid, and check win/loss conditions.
- [ ] **Handle actor interactions**: Implement logic for when the hunter captures the prey or the prey reaches the exit.
- [ ] **Record and store data**: Save game metrics, such as success rates and average times, for further analysis.
- [ ] **Implement basic grid visualization**: Use libraries like `matplotlib` or `seaborn` to display the grid, actors, and their movements.
- [ ] **Animate the game**: Create animations to show actor movements and changes in the grid over time.

### 5. Implement Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
- [ ] **Implement Q-learning algorithm**: Develop the Q-learning class, including methods for updating Q-values and selecting actions.
- [ ] **Implement SARSA algorithm**: Develop the SARSA class, including methods for updating Q-values based on the policyâ€™s actions.

### 7. Run Simulations
- [ ] **Automate running multiple games**: Create scripts to run multiple simulations to gather comprehensive data.


### 8. Analysis and Insights
- [ ] **Generate basic plots**: Create visualizations of the collected data, such as heatmaps of actor movements or performance trends over time.
- [ ] **Perform statistical analysis**: Analyze the data to derive insights into the effectiveness of different strategies and learning algorithms.

### 9. Test and Validate
- [ ] **Validate the implementation**: Ensure that the game logic, learning algorithms, and visualizations are working correctly.
- [ ] **Test different scenarios**: Run tests with various grid sizes, obstacle configurations, and learning parameters to evaluate performance and robustness.

### 10. Documentation and Reporting
- [ ] **Update documentation**: Ensure that all code, algorithms, and analysis are well-documented.
- [ ] **Prepare a final report**: Summarize the findings, performance metrics, and insights gained from the simulations.
