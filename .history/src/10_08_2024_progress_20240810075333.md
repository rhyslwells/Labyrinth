# Setting up enivorment.py summary

This setup creates a basic, visualizable 2D environment that you can use as a foundation for further development of the hunter-prey simulation.

1. **Environment Setup**: 
   - Created a Python class called `Environment` that manages a 2D grid representing the game environment.
   - The grid is initialized as a 2D numpy array where each cell can represent an empty space, an obstacle, an exit point, or an actor (hunter or prey).

2. **Obstacles and Exit Point**:
   - Added methods to place obstacles (`add_obstacle`) and set an exit point (`set_exit`) on the grid.
   - Obstacles are marked as `1` and the exit as `2` on the grid.

3. **Actor Placement**:
   - Introduced a method `place_actor` to place actors (hunter and prey) on the grid. Each actor is represented by a unique ID (`3` for the hunter and `4` for the prey).

4. **Grid Display**:
   - Implemented a `display` method to visualize the grid in the console, using symbols to represent different elements (e.g., `.` for empty, `#` for obstacles, `E` for the exit).
