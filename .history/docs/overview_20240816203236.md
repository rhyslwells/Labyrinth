# Overview

Inspired by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth and [OpenAI Plays Hide and Seekâ€¦and Breaks The Game! ðŸ¤–](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu56xVlZ40M&t=35s)

The project aims to model and simulate a pursuit dynamic between a hunter and prey in a 2D environment. We aim to use reinforcement learning to achieve this, and explore the resulting data of this learning process.

The goals of the project are to:


- Explore the emergent dynamics of actors with the setting.
- Analyse the outcomes of games over time.
- Provide a reasonable simulation of the scenario.
- Be able to run many simulations.
- Provide a visualisation for a given Game

To keep this project manageable we want to:

- Want to remain in Python and display solutions via Jupyter notebook.

# A Game Instance

A Game will consist of Actors within an Environment. 

A Game ends if an Actor reaches their objective, and a loss for all other Actors.

A Game can be visualised. In particular the Environment and Actors.

For each time step of a Game we record the position of Actors within the Environment in a Table.

Game statistics such as success rate, which actor wins, average time to catch, and escape rates, will be recorded for future analysis.

# Entities

As the movement dynamics and characteristics of both hunter and prey are similar. They will inherit from a parent class called Actor.

The Actor class:

- Focuses movement characteristics such as position and speed,
- Size and shape of actor.
- Actors will explore towards their objective.
- Actors can change speeds dynamically during the game. There is a fixed maximum speed they can attain.
- To navigate the actors will scan, make a decision, then travel in the direction of the decision. They will do this in discrete steps (aim to do this continuously).

The **Hunter** subclass:
- Moves towards the **Prey**
- The hunterâ€™s objective is to get to the **Prey**.
- If the hunter sees the prey (during a scan), the **Hunter** will want to minimize the distance from **Prey**.

The **Prey** subclass:
- The prey's objective is to get to the exit.
- If seen (during a scan) by the **Hunter** the **Prey** will want to maximize the distance from hunter
- The prey may approach the **Hunter** if it increases the total distance in the long run.

# Environment of a Game

Each Game will take place within an Environment. The Actorâ€™s will navigate within the Environment 

The Environment will have boundaries and obstacles that the Actorâ€™s interact with and can not pass through.
