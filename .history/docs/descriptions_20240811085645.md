Generating Game class that will capture and eviorment with actors moving.

What happens if the actor tries to move into the position of an obstacle. They should be not be permited to move in that direction, ie that do not move that way. 

We will focus on predefined movements first.
Summary
Random vs. Predefined Moves: The actor can now move randomly by default or follow a predefined sequence of moves if specified.
Flexibility: This allows you to test specific movement patterns and ensure the actor behaves as expected in different scenarios.

# Summary of setting up actor class

1. **Actor Initialization**: 
   - The `Actor` class is initialized with a starting position `(x, y)` and a movement speed, which determines how far the actor can move in one time step.

2. **Movement**:
   - The `move` method updates the actor's position on the grid based on a given direction, defined as a tuple `(dx, dy)`.

3. **Environment Scanning**:
   - The `scan` method checks the cells around the actor (up, down, left, right) to identify obstacles, the exit, or other actors.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - The `make_decision` method uses the scan results to decide the actor's next move. In the base class, the actor moves randomly to a direction that isn't blocked by an obstacle. This method is designed to be overridden in subclasses for more complex behavior.

5. **Time Step Execution**:
   - The `step` method simulates a single time step in the game by scanning the environment, deciding on a direction, and moving the actor accordingly.


# Summary of setting up enivorment class

This setup creates a basic, visualizable 2D environment that you can use as a foundation for further development of the hunter-prey simulation.

1. **Environment Setup**: 
   - Created a Python class called `Environment` that manages a 2D grid representing the game environment.
   - The grid is initialized as a 2D numpy array where each cell can represent an empty space, an obstacle, an exit point, or an actor (hunter or prey).

2. **Obstacles and Exit Point**:
   - Added methods to place obstacles (`add_obstacle`) and set an exit point (`set_exit`) on the grid.
   - Obstacles are marked as `1` and the exit as `2` on the grid.

3. **Actor Placement**:
   - Introduced a method `place_actor` to place actors (hunter and prey) on the grid. Each actor is represented by a unique ID (`3` for the hunter and `4` for the prey).

4. **Grid Display**:
   - Implemented a `display` method to visualize the grid in the console, using symbols to represent different elements (e.g., `.` for empty, `#` for obstacles, `E` for the exit).
