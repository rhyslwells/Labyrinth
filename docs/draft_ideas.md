Pursuit ideas

Model maze with many entrences with one exit fixed. say 3 of them

The prey will enter the maze from these. The hunter will be placed fixed in all cases to the center of the maze.

Analysis will focus on if the prey gets to the end or the hunter gets the prey.

We dont want the hunter to beeline for the prey especially if the hunter cannot see the prey.

I suspect the hunter will patrol a central area the prey has to move though to get to the exit.

Advanced Features

- We can vary the 2d mazes Environments.
- In displaying a Game we want to visualize the paths taken by the prey and hunter.
Support scenarios with multiple hunters and prey.
